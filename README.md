3. Double click on the CS3307.exe executable in order to run the program
4. In order to open and display the data from a file, go to the File->Open
5. Locate your file in the window that will pop up and click OK.
6. You can display more or less data for a particular section of the document by clicking the arrow beside each header.
7. The type of data displayed depends on the type of file used whether it be a presentations, publications, grants, or teaching file.
8. The program automatically removes any rows missing mandatory fields from being displayed. A list of rows with all mandatory fields they are missing can be found by going to File-> Display Errors. This will cause a separate window to pop up which can be scrolled to see all details.
9. In order to display the graph for an individual person, click on that person’s name in the Summary field to see the graph.
10. Go to Filter-> Set Year Range to change the range of years that are displayed in the GUI. Either a date range can be selected to just be applied to the current graph or it can be selected and applied to both the data-set and graphs. Selecting the second option will cause the GUI to refresh and the user can then select a person’s name to display the new graph from the updated data set.
11. In order to close a file, go to File-> Close File. A new file can then be selected to display to the screen. Alternatively, the user can also just open a new file from File->Open which will cause the current file to be closed and allow the new one’s data to be displayed.
