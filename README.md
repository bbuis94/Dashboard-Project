# The type of data displayed depends on the type of file used whether it be a presentations, publications, grants, or teaching file.
# The program automatically removes any rows missing mandatory fields from being displayed. A list of rows with all mandatory fields they are missing can be found by going to File-> Display Errors. This will cause a separate window to pop up which can be scrolled to see all details.
# In order to display the graph for an individual person, click on that person’s name in the Summary field to see the graph.
# Go to Filter-> Set Year Range to change the range of years that are displayed in the GUI. Either a date range can be selected to just be applied to the current graph or it can be selected and applied to both the data-set and graphs. Selecting the second option will cause the GUI to refresh and the user can then select a person’s name to display the new graph from the updated data set.
# In order to close a file, go to File-> Close File. A new file can then be selected to display to the screen. Alternatively, the user can also just open a new file from File->Open which will cause the current file to be closed and allow the new one’s data to be displayed.
# To go into full screen mode, click View->Fullscreen. To exit Full Screen mode, go to View -> Exit Fullscreen.
# To exit the program entirely, go to File -> Exit.
